				<p>Last year saw the UESP continue to grow impressively, with the most notable milestone being breaking past 100,000 content articles. </p>
				
				<p>Checking <a href="https://wikistats.wmcloud.org/largest_html.php?th=0&lines=500">WikiStats</a>, that puts us as the 213th largest wiki overall at time of writing. However, keeping in mind that about 129 of the ones ahead of us are all different branches of Wikipedia, so we are arguably in the top 100 largest wikis in the world!</p>
				
				<p>From the official side of things, we saw the long-anticipated release of <a href="https://starfieldwiki.net/wiki/Starfield:Starfield">Starfield</a>, the ESO <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Necrom">Necrom</a> expansion, updates to Skyrim, and the surprise pre-release of The Elder Scrolls: <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Castles:Castles">Castles</a>.</p>

								<h2 class="heading">CSlist expanded to support multiple languages</h2>
							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										UESP started off the year by expanding our <a href="https://cslist.uesp.net/">CSList</a> game database to cover multiple languages.
										Some translated in-game texts can have drastic differences, as translators often end up working with outdated versions of texts. 
									</p>
									
									<p>One example comes from non-English versions of The Real Barenziah, which worked off of the Daggerfall version due to time constraints, and <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Real_Barenziah,_v_2">as such was never censored like the English equivalent</a>.</p>
		
									<p>We also hope this will help <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Hosted_Wikis"">UESP translation projects</a>, wherever they may arise. As one of the few clear options we have available to aid them without learning additional languages to build these wikis ourselves, we hope this will prove useful to them.</p>

								<div class="text">
									<p>
										The ESO team invites Dave Humphrey, founder of UESP, to a private playtest of the ESO:Necrom chapter. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Whilst there, he had the opportunity to ask community questions had about the expansion, and to see the technical side of things we don't see as much of. </p>
									</p>
									<p>
										Dave would later post his impressions on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/eso-necrom-81373305">12 Apr 2023</a> in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/eso-necrom-81373305">private Patreon post</a>.

							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										RobinHood70, wiki administrator and template wizard rewrote MetaTemplate - a major extension used in many of UESP's wiki templates.This work added some minor features, and brought it up to modern MediaWiki standards, allowing it to be more easily maintained in future.

							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										Several community editors finished a months-long comprehensive overhaul of the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Vivec">Lore:Vivec</a> page, which attempted to account for all the nuances and conflicting accounts of the Dark Elf Tribunal god Vivec’s origins and history. The revamp began April 28th, and the last major section was added June 29th.

							</div>
							<div class="content">
								<div class="text">
									<p>
										Dave migrated UESP.net to MediaWiki 1.30, the software that powers UESP.net under the hood. The update was part of the never stopping march of progress for mediawiki software. Whilst not a super exciting update, it allowed UESP.net to host and play midi files, which wasn't possible before. It also resolved an information coverage issue.
									</p>
									<p>
										It took 20 minutes in total, and no downtime was recorded.

									<p>
										In early August 2023, UESP released a complete overhaul of our online <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Maps">interactive maps</a> system, which was over a year in the making. This was a close-to-ground-up rework of our map system, focusing on performance and mobile friendliness, as the old one had several bugs and was proving hard to navigate on mobile.
									</p>
									<p>
										The new release was roughly 50-60% faster than the older version, in addition to several improvements to accessibility and web standards.

	Or images
	
	
	RobinHood70 — Today at 16:39
	I completely rewrote MetaTemplate and released that on April 17. How you put that in a review, I don't know, cuz it wouldn't translate well to the average editor (or even a lot of template editors). Probably just something like "modernized some old, high-use code" or words to that effect.
	ThalJ — Today at 16:42
	"rewrote wiki template system"
	
	That's a bit broad. Makes it sound like a rewrote large swaths of the MediaWiki code. 🙂 Ummm...let me think....
	"Rewrote an extension used in many of our templates"? Does that work? It's a little fuzzier to say "Rewrote code use in...", but it still kinda works if you wanna make it simpler.
