					Overall, 2023 was a good growth year for the UESP. It was marked by the release of the anticipated Starfield, the ESO Necrom expansion, and the surprise pre-release of Castles. 
					The wiki community also came together, pushing us over 100k articles, which is a massive milestone for the site.
					Keep on reading to learn about the last year's developments, highlights, and how the community united in 2023.

									<p>
										UESP started off the year by expanding our <a href="https://cslist.uesp.net/">CSList</a> game database to cover multiple languages.
										Some translated in-game texts can have drastic differences, as translators often end up working with outdated versions of texts. One example comes from non-English versions of The Real Barenziah, which worked off of the Daggerfall version due to time constraints, and <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Real_Barenziah,_v_2">as such was never censored like the English equivalent</a>.
										We also hope this will help <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Hosted_Wikis"">UESP translation projects</a>, wherever they may arise. As one of the few clear options we have available to aid them without learning additional languages to build these wikis ourselves, we hope this will prove useful to them.

	ThalJ â€” 09/01/2024 16:06
	are you ok with shouting out particular users? also do you have a rough timeline of significant events in the year (when we hit 100k, maps, wiki upgrades)
	Dave (UESP) â€” 09/01/2024 16:07
	I think so (depending what we're shouting out I suppose).
	Let me check the dates quick
	11 October: Upgraded primary write database server.
	5 July: Updated MediaWiki to 1.30.
	August: Started the Starfield Wiki.
	?: Updated maps to a completely new system.
	Discord formats those lists weird....
	I don't remember when we switched to the new maps exactly
	
	Could mention featured articles for this year
	Or images

	I completely rewrote MetaTemplate and released that on April 17. How you put that in a review, I don't know, cuz it wouldn't translate well to the average editor (or even a lot of template editors). Probably just something like "modernized some old, high-use code" or words to that effect.
	ThalJ â€” Today at 16:42
	"rewrote wiki template system"
	
	That's a bit broad. Makes it sound like a rewrote large swaths of the MediaWiki code. ðŸ™‚ Ummm...let me think....
	"Rewrote an extension used in many of our templates"? Does that work? It's a little fuzzier to say "Rewrote code use in...", but it still kinda works if you wanna make it simpler.
