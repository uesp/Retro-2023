						Welcome to UESP's <b>2024 Retrospective</b>! This is the second year in a row we've done this, and just like <a href="https://retro.uesp.net/2023/">last time</a>, we're going to take a look back at some of the things we've done over this past year.

						<a href="https://wikistats.wmcloud.org/largest_html.php?th=0&lines=500">WikiStats</a> shows UESP has grown relative to the other wikis out there once again, but we don't have anything quite as interesting to point out like last year where we reached over 100K total articles. Still, we have seen substantial growth on that front, taking the 209th rank at the current time of writing with 107,883 articles. In total we have <b>32,555</b> new pages, which is pretty close to the number from last year.

					<h1>Wiki Spotlight</h1>

					<p>
						The UESP is a constantly growing entity, with over 100,000 content pages! This retrospective can't go over everything that was added to the UESP this year, so we're going to try something a bit different this year. 
					</p>

					<p>
						We've reached out to some of our community editors, and asked them about some of the best new or updated pages on the wiki, and we wanted to spotlight them for you here!
					</p>

					<h2>Featured Articles</h2>

					<p>
						The following are a selection of this year's <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Featured_Articles">Featured Articles</a>, which are articles the UESP's users deem to be of the highest quality and should be held up as an example for other articles. These articles help push the standards for the UESP further.
					</p>

									<h3 class="title">Chrysamere</h3>
									<span class="description">Chrysamere (also called the Chrysamere Blade, or the Chrysamere) is an ancient adamantium claymore artifact with offensive capabilities only surpassed by its defenses. It has magical properties which, unlike most weapons, are defensive in nature: it heals the wielder, grants them resistance to fire, and reflects hostile spells. It is unaligned, and is not a Daedric artifact. Chrysamere was forged in the late Merethic Era by the Breton swordsmith Asterie Bedel, who delighted in using the techniques of both man and mer in her creations.</span>

									<h3 class="title">Ayleid Empire</h3>
									<span class="description">The Ayleid Empire (or imperatum saliache) was the original dominant power in Cyrod. It was composed of multiple city-states, ruled by the Ayleid sorcerer-kings. The empire's roots began in the Middle Merethic Era, when established Ayleid settlements flourished in the Heartlands. Though they were ostensibly a tribute-land to the High King of Alinor, the distance between Cyrodiil and Summerset's communication lines led to the Ayleids' isolation and eventual detachment. Their fall is attributed to their arrogant pride of their achievements and smug self-assurance that their empire would last forever, which doomed them to fail and fade into obscurity.</span>

									<h3 class="title">Molag Bal</h3>
									<span class="description">Molag Bal is the Daedric Prince of Domination and the Enslavement of Mortals. He is the main antagonist of ESO, and is attempting to pull Nirn into his realm of Oblivion, Coldharbour, in an event known as the Planemeld. Molag Bal has stolen the soul of the player, forbidding them to die. To reclaim your soul, you must save Tamriel from the Prince's clutches.</span>

					<h2>Gold Road</h2>

					<p>
						With the release of ESO's <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Gold_Road">Gold Road</a> Chapter, hundreds of pages for <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Scions_of_Ithelia">Scions of Ithelia</a>, Gold Road, New Battlegrounds & Companions-related topics were created. Here were the main ones.

									<span class="description">Ithelia is the Daedric Prince of Paths and Mistress of the Untraveled Road. She had been sealed away by the combined efforts of Hermaeus Mora and several other Princes, due to her perceived threat on the fabric of reality, and all memory of her was wiped from the Aurbis.</span>

									<span class="description">Mirrormoor was the realm of the Daedric Prince Ithelia, Mistress of the Untraveled Road.
										Mirrormoor is a large desert wasteland filled with gargantuan skeletons and surrounded by an auroral sky. While Ithelia is active, it is filled by shattered mirrors and crystalline structures and the sky is fractured by cracks. Those elements were not present in Fargrave before Ithelia's return.

							<div class="text">
								<p>
									UESP started off the year by expanding our <a href="https://cslist.uesp.net/">CSList</a> game database to cover multiple languages.
									Some translated in-game texts can have drastic differences, as translators often end up working with outdated versions of texts. 
								</p>
								
								<p>One example comes from non-English versions of The Real Barenziah, which worked off of the Daggerfall version due to time constraints, and <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Real_Barenziah,_v_2">as such was never censored like the English equivalent</a>.</p>

								<p>We also hope this will help <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Hosted_Wikis"">UESP translation projects</a>, wherever they may arise. As one of the few clear options we have available to aid them without learning additional languages to build these wikis ourselves, we hope this will prove useful to them.</p>

					<h1>Traffic & Outages</h1>

					<p> 
						On the server side, we've had a relatively uneventful 2024, although with a few more outages than last year, resulting in a couple of hours of downtime for one or more servers overall.
					</p>

					<p> 
						Besides planned maintenance, all outages were the result of overzealous and poorly implemented bots/crawlers who either requested pages too quickly or requested CPU heavy content (like article diffs) that caused server load issues and either slow page loads or outright server outages.
					</p>

					<p>
						For now, these bots/crawlers have been dealt with by IP blocks. Most of them have been from China so large IP range blocks shouldn't affect our actual users.
					</p>

					<p>
						We've also disabled article diffs for anonymous users temporarily. In 2025 we want to look at better automatic protections that would prevent a poorly implemented crawler or malicious user from causing site slowdowns or outages.

					<h1>Thank You!</h1>

					<p> 
						Once again, we want to thank you for joining us in exploring Tamriel and beyond over the last year.
					</p>

					<p>
						2024 brought us the 30th anniversary of The Elder Scrolls, and 2025 will bring the 30th anniversary of the UESP. We've been walking this path from the earliest days of this series, and we've had literal generations of Elder Scrolls fans brought together in our community. It's an incredible privilege and opportunity, and we cannot thank you all enough for giving it to us.
					</p>

					<p>
						We do have some incredible plans for the UESP's future, but wherever those plans take us, we are happy that we get to work through our path with all of you. See you in Year 30!
