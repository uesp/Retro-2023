				2024 was the 30th anniversary of The Elder Scrolls. On March 25th, we celebrated this milestone for the series, although it is a bit more complicated than that. March 25th is the official anniversary for the release of Arena, but there isn't truly an official release date. Game release dates were not as set in stone in the past as they are now, and our research suggests that the game may have actually been out in February, with at least one person back then claiming that a patch for the game had already been distributed.
Elder Scrolls Online concludes the story of Ithelia.
The UESP, as it does with every ESO chapter, begun the documentation process of the incredibly large amount of new content that it brought to The Elder Scrolls. ESO has an almost staggering amount of content, and working through it all to get it into a readable format is always a challenge. But we've made gigantic strides. One statistic that has been brought up regularly is the decreasing number of ESO NPC pages needing images, which at time of writing is currently 1,553 pages. This may sound like a lot, but we have 25,747 NPC pages for ESO. 94% of all NPC pages having images (and often notable content beyond it) is pretty astounding!
ESO tenth anniversary, and UESP meetup there!

								<p>
									UESP started off the year by expanding our <a href="https://cslist.uesp.net/">CSList</a> game database to cover multiple languages.
									Some translated in-game texts can have drastic differences, as translators often end up working with outdated versions of texts. 
								</p>
								
								<p>One example comes from non-English versions of The Real Barenziah, which worked off of the Daggerfall version due to time constraints, and <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Real_Barenziah,_v_2">as such was never censored like the English equivalent</a>.</p>

								<p>We also hope this will help <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/UESPWiki:Hosted_Wikis"">UESP translation projects</a>, wherever they may arise. As one of the few clear options we have available to aid them without learning additional languages to build these wikis ourselves, we hope this will prove useful to them.</p>
